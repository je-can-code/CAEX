Haven't tested gamepad in awhile, so not sure if it still works.

If you find any bugs or crashes let me know. In the QABS help there isn't much yet.
It has a list of all the enemy / state notetags you can use. And a list of all the actions for a 
skill sequence. But it's nearly identical to QuasiABS, and you can find those docs here:
