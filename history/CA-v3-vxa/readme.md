### CA-v3-ace: Project Cakes, on RPG Maker VX Ace.
Enter, the third version. This was created from scratch, using unlike the previous two versions which were basically a branch off of one another in the same environment... THIS one is was developed in VX Ace, two generations of RM later, and obviously with a different backend engine for the ABS instead. Instead of different classes, a pair of characters were introduced alongside a seemingly relevant story to match. Eventually, life got in the way again, and this project was abandoned until the current version you see in the making now.
