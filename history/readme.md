The Evolution of Chef Adventure
======
## Wait, there's a history?!
Chef adventure, as I've mentioned before, is an age-old game in the making for years and years. Basically when I wanted to be creative, and entertain people (like my friends) at the same time, I would come to these projects and let loose my creative energies.

## CA-v1-xp: Chef Adventure, on RPG Maker XP.
The first version of the game, spawned back in about 2008 or so, when I was working on it, was with a single character (found a spritesheet that I liked) and expanded on it, and within it is a relatively longer cave dungeon than other versions I've made. It is enjoyable, but there is little customization which I found made it kinda boring to make and play, so then I moved onto the second version.

## CA-v2-xp: Chef Adventure EX!, on RPG Maker XP.
The second version of this game was developed after a small stint of not working on the first version due to boredom. I wanted a reason to be not-bored, so sometime around 2010, I made this version, with a focus on variety and customization. Classes, stat point distribution, variety of map types ranging from cave to forest to mountain, so on. Eventually, life got in the way and I had to take an extended break, and when I came back to it, I had long forgotten where I was going with it.

## CA-v3-ace: Project Cakes, on RPG Maker VX Ace.
Enter, the third version. This was created from scratch, using unlike the previous two versions which were basically a branch off of one another in the same environment... THIS one is was developed in VX Ace, two generations of RM later, and obviously with a different backend engine for the ABS instead. Instead of different classes, a pair of characters were introduced alongside a seemingly relevant story to match. Eventually, life got in the way again, and this project was abandoned until the current version you see in the making now.
