### CA-v2-xp: Chef Adventure EX!, on RPG Maker XP.
The second version of this game was developed after a small stint of not working on the first version due to boredom. I wanted a reason to be not-bored, so sometime around 2010, I made this version, with a focus on variety and customization. Classes, stat point distribution, variety of map types ranging from cave to forest to mountain, so on. Eventually, life got in the way and I had to take an extended break, and when I came back to it, I had long forgotten where I was going with it.
